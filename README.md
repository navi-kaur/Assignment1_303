# Assignment1_303
This is a program that reads numbers from a file and adds it to an array.
The GetIndex function is called using the array name, array size, and target index. This ouputs the value stored in the target index. 
A vector is declared to store all of the values, modify the target values, and output the old and new values.
The addValues function is called, which adds values to the end of an array. The following for loop outputs the values including the new ones.
The Remove function removes the value stored at the target index.
A new array is created to demonstrate the try and throw for the AddToEnd function. A for loop outputs all of the values. In the try block, the AddToEnd function is called using a index value that is out of bounds. The error is caught and a statement is outputted. 
A new array is created to demonstrate the try and throw for the modifyValues function. A for loop outputs all of the values. In the try block, the modifyValues function is called using an index that is out of bounds. The error is caught and outputs a statement.
